# bts-v1



So this is a very simple REST server built with express. 

Its purpose is to demo scheduling different services that businesses may have. The idea is that a customer will log in, search for a business (eg: dentist), and make an appointment with that business. The business should be able to see their scheduled appointments and manage them appropriately.


This is not a complete server app though. It is still in the works. It's just something I'm working on just because. Many improvements can be made but feel free to make comments/suggestions.
